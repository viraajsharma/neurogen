# NeuroGen V3 – Speciation, Surrogate Models, & Annealing

## Objectives
- Introduce speciation to preserve diverse sub‑populations during evolution.
- Implement surrogate models to approximate fitness and reduce evaluation cost.
- Add annealing schedules for mutation rates and learning‑rule parameters.

## New Features
- **Speciation**: Genetic distance metric groups genomes into species; intra‑species competition encourages niche preservation.
- **Surrogate Models**: Lightweight regression models predict fitness of candidate genomes, allowing early‑stop evaluations.
- **Annealing Scheduler**: Gradually reduces mutation probability and learning‑rule step sizes as evolution progresses.
- **Enhanced Fitness Function**: Balances task performance with model complexity and novelty.

## Technical Changes
- Added `neurogen/core/speciation.py` handling species assignment and migration.
- Integrated `neurogen/core/surrogate.py` using scikit‑learn’s `RandomForestRegressor` for fitness prediction.
- Implemented `neurogen/core/annealing.py` providing exponential decay schedules.
- Updated engine loop in `neurogen/core/engine.py` to incorporate speciation and surrogate evaluation phases.
- New demo `neurogen/tasks/speciation_demo.py` showcasing speciation on a multi‑modal benchmark.

## Expected Outcomes
- Evolution maintains multiple high‑performing niches, preventing premature convergence.
- Reduced computational load via surrogate‑guided evaluations, enabling larger population sizes.
- More stable convergence thanks to annealed mutation dynamics.

## Research Motivation
Speciation mirrors biological evolution’s preservation of diversity, a known challenge in neuro‑evolution. Surrogate models address the high cost of evaluating complex tasks, while annealing provides a principled way to transition from exploration to exploitation.
