## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### **Step 1: Set Up Git Branches**
```bash
# Follow instructions in docs/DEV_BRANCH_SETUP.md
git checkout main
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
git checkout -b dev/v1.1
git push -u origin dev/v1.1
```

### **Step 2: Set Up Environment**
```bash
# Follow instructions in docs/REPRODUCIBLE_ENVIRONMENT.md
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 3: Review Architecture**
```bash
# Read docs/ARCHITECTURE.md to understand v1.0 baseline
# This is your reference for what exists and how it works
```

### **Step 4: Plan v1.1 Work**
```bash
# Review TODO_v1.1.md for the 5 major problems to solve
# Prioritize: Config system, Logging, Dataset, Reproducibility, Modularity
```

### **Step 5: Create Folder Structure**
```bash
# Follow docs/FOLDER_STRUCTURE_V1.1.md
mkdir -p configs configs/tasks
mkdir -p core/evolution
mkdir -p training
mkdir -p data data/datasets
mkdir -p tests
mkdir -p experiments experiments/runs
mkdir -p scripts
```

### **Step 6: Generate Synthetic Dataset**
```bash
# Implement data/synthetic_dataset.py following SYNTHETIC_DATASET_PLAN.md
# Then generate the dataset:
python scripts/generate_synthetic_data.py
```

### **Step 7: Start Development**
```bash
# Begin implementing v1.1 features from TODO_v1.1.md
# Start with P0 priorities: Config, Logging, Dataset, Reproducibility
```

## 🎓 Key Principles for v1.1

1. **Configuration Over Code**: Externalize all parameters
2. **Reproducibility First**: Deterministic runs with seed control
3. **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns
4. **Testability**: Unit tests for all core components
5. **Documentation**: Every module has clear purpose
6. **Version Control**: Pin all dependencies
