# NeuroGen V4 – Modular Growth, Gating, & Meta‑Parameter Optimization

## Objectives
- Enable modular growth of network components, allowing sub‑networks to be added or removed dynamically.
- Introduce gating mechanisms that control information flow between modules.
- Provide meta‑learning capabilities for automatic tuning of hyper‑parameters across evolution runs.

## New Features
- **Modular Growth**: Architecture can spawn new modules (sub‑graphs) during evolution, each with its own genome segment.
- **Gating Mechanisms**: Learnable gates (similar to LSTM gates) regulate inter‑module communication, improving scalability.
- **Meta‑Parameter Optimization**: Evolutionary outer‑loop optimizes mutation rates, learning‑rule schedules, and gating hyper‑parameters.
- **Hierarchical Fitness**: Combines module‑level performance with overall task success.

## Technical Changes
- Added `neurogen/core/modular.py` defining `Module` class, growth operators, and gate implementations.
- Extended genome schema in `neurogen/core/genome.py` to encode module identifiers and gate parameters.
- Implemented `neurogen/core/meta_optimizer.py` that runs a secondary evolutionary process to tune meta‑parameters.
- Updated engine loop in `neurogen/core/engine.py` to handle module creation, gating updates, and meta‑optimization steps.
- New demo `neurogen/tasks/modular_demo.py` illustrating modular growth on a multi‑task benchmark.

## Expected Outcomes
- Ability to evolve larger, more complex networks while maintaining training stability.
- Improved performance on multi‑task and hierarchical problems.
- Reduced manual hyper‑parameter tuning via automated meta‑learning.

## Research Motivation
Scaling evolutionary neural networks to real‑world problems requires modularity and adaptive control of information flow. V4 addresses these challenges by mimicking biological modular organization and providing automated meta‑learning, pushing NeuroGen toward practical, large‑scale AI research.
