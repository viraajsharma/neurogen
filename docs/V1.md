# NeuroGen V1 – Minimal Evolutionary Learning Engine

## Objectives
- Provide a functional evolutionary engine capable of evolving neural networks to solve simple logical tasks (e.g., XOR).
- Demonstrate genome‑driven network construction and dynamic topology mutations.

## New Features
- Evolutionary search over network architectures.
- Genome encoding of nodes, edges, and mutation parameters.
- Local learning rules (Hebbian, Oja, BCM, STDP) applied after each generation.
- Dynamic addition/removal of nodes and edges.

## Technical Changes
- Core engine implemented in `neurogen/core/engine.py`.
- Genome representation in `neurogen/core/genome.py`.
- Mutation operators and fitness evaluation added.
- XOR demo script `neurogen/tasks/xor.py`.

## Expected Outcomes
- Ability to evolve a network that achieves 100 % accuracy on XOR within ~150 generations.
- Visualization of fitness curve and final network topology.

## Research Motivation
Backpropagation limits biological plausibility and architecture flexibility. V1 showcases a proof‑of‑concept for backprop‑free learning, laying groundwork for richer learning rules and larger‑scale tasks in subsequent versions.
