# NeuroGen V2 – Expanded Learning Rules & Novelty Search

## Objectives
- Introduce additional local learning rules (e.g., Oja, BCM) alongside Hebbian and STDP.
- Implement novelty‑search mechanisms to encourage diverse architectures.
- Support symbolic reasoning tasks beyond simple logical gates.

## New Features
- **Learning Rules**: Added Oja and BCM implementations with configurable learning rates.
- **Novelty Search**: Archive of behavior descriptors; selection favors novel phenotypes.
- **Symbolic Tasks**: Framework for defining symbolic regression and rule‑based problems.
- **Configurable Rule Scheduler**: Allows mixing of multiple learning rules during evolution.

## Technical Changes
- Extended `neurogen/core/learning_rules.py` with Oja and BCM classes.
- Added `neurogen/core/novelty.py` handling behavior descriptors and archive management.
- Updated genome representation to store rule‑specific hyper‑parameters.
- New demo `neurogen/tasks/symbolic_demo.py` illustrating symbolic regression.

## Expected Outcomes
- Evolutionary runs produce more diverse network topologies.
- Ability to solve symbolic regression benchmarks (e.g., fitting polynomial functions).
- Improved exploration leading to faster convergence on complex tasks.

## Research Motivation
While V1 proved the feasibility of backprop‑free evolution, it was limited to a single learning rule and a simple task. V2 expands the biological plausibility and search diversity, addressing the need for richer learning dynamics and task variety in neuro‑evolution research.
